The malware powering the botnet has been around since 2006 and itâ€™s known under various names, including Ponmocup, Vundo, Virtumonde, Milicenso and Swisyn. It has been used for ad fraud, data theft and downloading additional threats to infected systems. Ponmocup is one of the largest currently active and, with nine consecutive years, also one of the longest running, but it is rarely noticed as the operators take care to keep it operating under the radar.'

        [Abuse.ch Feodo tracker C2](https://feodotracker.abuse.ch)
        Dridex, Heodo (aka Emotet), TrickBot, QakBot (aka QuakBot / Qbot) and BazarLoader (aka BazarBackdoor) botnet command&control servers (C2s) usually reside on compromised servers and such that have been rented and setup by the threat actor itself for the sole purpose of botnet hosting. Feodo Tracker offers a blocklist of IP addresses that are associated with such botnet C2s. It can be used to block botnet C2 traffic from infected machines towards hostline servers on the internet that are under the control of cybercriminals.

        To keep the false positive rate as low as possible, an IP address will only get added to the blocklist if it responds with a valid botnet C2 response.
